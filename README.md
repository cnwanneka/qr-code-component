# QR code component

The objective of this project was to design a qr code component.

URL of the deployed application: https://cnwanneka.github.io/qr-code-component/

I was motivated to design this qr code component because it enabled me to practise some of the css techniques that I had learnt.

I faced some challenges while designing this qr code component, for example, rounding the edges around the card and also adding a gap around the card but I found a solution for them after doing some research on the internet.
