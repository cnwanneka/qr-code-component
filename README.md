# QR code component

The objective of this project was to design the qr code component to look as close as possible to the one that was provided.

URL of the deployed application: https://cnwanneka.github.io/qr-code-component/

I faced some challenges while designing this qr code component, for example, rounding the edges around the card and also adding a gap around the card but I found a solution for them after doing some research on the internet.
